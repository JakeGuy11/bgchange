# changebg
*changebg* is a little script I'm making for changing the background of i3. It'll use `feh` for the actual background tool, and change the background every *n* seconds, *n* defined as the first cli arg and the path to the directory holding the backgrounds as the second cli arg.\
This is mainly for personal use so I'm not going to put much here.
